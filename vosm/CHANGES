      a) Boost (>= 1.34.1) for file and directory operations
      b) OpenCV (subervsion R3594 or above) as the basic but primary libraries 
         that VOSM 0.3.1 is built upon

   - A formal documentation is produced for reference

   - Add brief descriptions for every class


----------------------------- Release 0.3 --November, 2010--------------------

It has been a long time for Vision Open to release its recent 
research fruits related to ASM/AAMs.
VOSM 0.3 offers a thoroughly fresh coding implementations, 
and lots of improvements and new functionalities :

    - Must be OpenCV SVN R3594 or above 
	  (OpenCV 2.1 is too old to be compile with current VOSM 0.3)

2 Algorithms

  - Current VOSM affords 2D Profile ASM, which is dramatically faster
    than traditional 1D Profile ASM.

  - Current VOSM proposes a conceptual novel idea named as
    Active Feature Model.

  - Current VOSM implements all popular ASMs/AAMs,
    both for static images and dynamic videos, including:

	- 1D profile ASM

    - 2D profile ASM

    - Direct Local texture contrained (LTC) ASM

    - Basic AAM

    - ICIA(Inverse compositional image alignment) AAM

    - IAIA(Inverse additive image alignment) AAM

----------------------------- Release 0.2 -- April, 2008----------------------

Second release of "AAMBuilding":

    - No source, but a xwWidget based GUI application 
	  with some binary static libraries for model building.

----------------------------- Release 0.1 -- February, 2007-------------------

Initial release of "AAMBuilding", 

  	- Contains only the model building code.
